Report of App: The application that I made is meant for a friend. They require this app so that they can know what meals they can eat at a certain time of day. This can be used by many people as it gives suggestions for meals to eat depending on the time of day. The application has a food-related background to make it more in tune with the idea, and it has instructions on TextView to show what the user is supposed to enter. The application also has EditText so that the user can enter the required input depending on their time of day. The application also has buttons: an exit button, a clear button, and a meal suggestion button, which will provide an output depending on the information entered. The app itself serves as a stress-free way to get meal suggestions and can help more individuals than just my friend.
